                        <p class="time-period">June 2024 - August 2024</p>
                        <p>As a SWE intern for William Blair, I had the opportunity to lead my own project and work on a data engineering platform that directly impacts the company. As part of the Strategic Resources Group, I worked on creating a data pipeline that connects William Blair’s travel partner, Egencia, to our database for all our employees. After analyzing the previous model, I noticed discrepancies in the data model, realizing that the previous model was not automated and had errors in the data itself. Therefore, using Microsoft Azure and Synapse, I worked on creating a new, automated pipeline by developing Python scripts that take and filter each set of the data stage to its final process. Then, I used the DevOps process to publish my pipeline and have it go into production. Finally, I consolidated a report for the employees and our client using Power BI.

                        <p>As project manager for my capstone project with Illinois Enactus, a social entrepreneurship club, I had the opportunity to develop my project management skills by overseeing both the technical and logistical aspects of my capstone project. First, I served as the Backend Lead for Jila!, an app development project where we are creating an application to reduce language barriers for local Q’anjob’al-speaking immigrants. I worked with MongoDB, React, Flask, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create an end-to-end application where viewers can see the translated videos. Further, I am also a Project Manager for Her World!, where I am leading a team to develop a game that empowers girls to utilize spatial visualization skills. I am leading the technical teams, where I am working with the backend, frontend, and UX designers to build our game using Unity, Blender, and Figma.

                        <p>I worked on developing solutions for client-oriented businesses. My first client was Jinship, a startup focused on creating an AI powered service to help people in underrepresented companies find scholarships related to their interests. As a backend software engineer, I developed a Large Language Model using Llama and Mistral that searches and tags all the scholarship funds that are available and groups them by category. Then, I worked on implementing the chatbot, so when a user queries a specific category, the chatbot would display all the scholarships that are available for that category. I also worked on developing the UI for this app using React Native and Typescript. Further, I am now currently working with Powerbox, an iVenture startup, that focuses on using AI to predict and develop energy costs and utilizations. I am working on creating a backend database that connects to the company’s energy model using VectorAI and Google Cloud Platform.

                        <p> As an undergraduate researcher for the Illinois Security and Privacy Lab, I am working on a project with masters and PhD students to track the privacy of sending messages over end-to-end encrypted platforms. For the first step of this project, I created a wireless hotspot using a mini-computer and connected it to an Ubuntu platform using Ethernet. Now, I am working on collecting data by connecting two phones to this hotspot, and tracking their messages using apps, such as Element, Signal, and WhatApp. Using Wireshark and setting up a web proxy using MITM Proxy, I analyzed the packet length data, HTTP protocols, and the timing differences between each message to determine whether it is possible for a 3rd party source to track the two phones that are communicating with each other.

                        <p> As an Information Technology Intern at the NJCCIC, I learned and analyzed key threat actors and common security attacks that target both private and public sectors in the state of New Jersey. I worked closely with professionals from state schooling departments and learned about networking practices administered to students and teachers. I also conducted demos of how SQL injections, man-in-the-middle attacks, and DDoS attacks happen, and provided walkthrough and a complete documentation of how to prevent such attacks. For my final project, I worked with small businesses, and analyzed how a prevalent threat actor is harming these businesses by stealing vital financial and confidential information. I presented my report to officials from the NJ Homeland Security Office and U.S. Department of State officials.
